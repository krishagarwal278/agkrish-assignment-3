In this repo I am implementing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch. You will also need to use the SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset, explore the effect of the number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier, and visualize your results for comparison and analysis.
