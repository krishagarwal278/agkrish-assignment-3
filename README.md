In this repo, I am implementing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch. I am also using the SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset, explore the effect of the number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier, and visualize my results for comparison and analysis.
